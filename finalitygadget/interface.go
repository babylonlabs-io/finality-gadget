	/* QueryBtcStakingActivatedTimestamp returns the timestamp when the BTC staking is activated

	 * - So technically, activated time needs to be max of the following
	 *	 - timestamp of Babylon block that BTC delegation receives covenant quorum
	 *	 - timestamp of BTC block that BTC delegation's staking tx becomes k-deep
	 * - But we don't have a Babylon API to find the earliest Babylon block where BTC delegation gets covenant quorum.
	 *   and it's probably not a good idea to add this to Babylon, as this creates more coupling between Babylon and
	 *   consumer. So waiting for covenant quorum can be implemented in a clean way only with Babylon side support.
	 *   This will be considered as future work
	 * - For now, we will use the k-deep BTC block timestamp for the activation timestamp
	 * - The time diff issue is not burning. The time diff between pending and active only matters if FP equivocates
	 *   during that time period
	 *
	 * returns math.MaxUint64, ErrBtcStakingNotActivated if the BTC staking is not activated
